# springboard_DSC
Springboard Data Science Career track, non-capstone projects
Completed by Leo Evancie

This repository exists for me to submit checkpoint assignments to Springboard.

Contrary to the heavier-hitting capstone projects (found [here](https://github.com/levancie/spotify-popularity)
and [here](https://github.com/levancie/customer-segmentation)),
These are mini-projects, serving as checkpoints throughout the
curriculum.

Generally, the projects in this repository are scaffolded, and as such, they
are not to represent fully original work on my part. The assignments involve
completing what has been started, and/or manipulating the provided code to
answer questions and submit assignment deliverables. Much of the comments
and context listed in the project files represent instructions written by the
course administrators.
