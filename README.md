Springboard Data Science Career track, non-capstone projects
Completed by Leo Evancie

This repository exists for me to submit completed assignments to Springboard. 
These are mini-projects, serving as checkpoints throughout the
curriculum. Generally, these projects are scaffolded, and as such, they
are not to represent fully original work on my part. The assignments involve
completing what has been started, and/or manipulating the provided code to
answer questions and submit assignment deliverables. Much of the comments
and context listed in the project files represent instructions written by the
course administrators.
